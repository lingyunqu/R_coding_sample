I use this coding sample to illustrate my R coding techniques and aesthetic tastes. I cleaned the data, switched arrangement for those pairs with reversed result under A1 criteria, and consciously excluded SNPs with information incon- sistent with the background. Since the case aiming at discussing the impact of certain gene on agentsâ€™ behaviors, I also considered the distribution of p-values produced from a two-sided test of the null hypothesis for each SNP (single nu- cleotide polymorphisms, regarded as the independent variable in this analysis) in the GWAS (genome-wide association study, consists of running this regres- sion for all SNPs) results. Therefore, I conducted visualizations of the data by Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot of the p-values generated from the GWAS, and produced analysis. The data has been masked.
